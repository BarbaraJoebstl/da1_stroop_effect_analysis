# Analyze of the Stroop effect
This project is an assignment of the Udacity [Nanodegree Data Analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

##Project Overview
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

Following questions are answered in this project:

1. What is the independent variable?
2. What is the dependent variable?
3. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task?
4. What kind of statistical test shall be performed?

Those sections are included in the project:

1. Reporting of descriptive statistics with measures of central tendency and measures of variability.
2. Visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. 
3. A paired t-test is conducted.

##Run
